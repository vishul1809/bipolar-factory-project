# bipolar-factory-project
This project builds an object detection model using a ResNet-50 backbone with a Feature Pyramid Network and Faster R-CNN architecture. It trains on the Pascal VOC 2012 dataset using dummy bounding boxes for demonstration. The model performs inference and visualizes predictions with bounding boxes on sample images.
